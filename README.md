## Part 1
### Description
This part of the project focuses on implementing the shortest path algorithm approximations for Dijkstra and Bellman Ford. There is also a mystery algorithm.
### Files
* `final_project_part1.py` - This file contains the code for the shortest path algorithms.

## Part 2
### Description
This part of the project focuses on implementing the a star shortest path algorithm.
### Files
* `final_project_part2.py` - This file contains the code for the a* algorithm.

## Part 3
### Description
This part of the project focuses on implementing the London Underground graph and the shortest path algorithms. It also includes a visualization of the London Underground.
### Files
* `final_project_part3.py` - This file contains the code for the london underground graph construction, algorithms, and testing.
* `visualization.py` - This file contains the code for the visualization of the London Underground.

## Part 4
### Description
This part contains a refactored collection of code from the previous parts as well as the broken station problem.
### Files
* `ShortPathFinder.py` - This file contains all the refactored code for part 4.
* `final_project_part4.py` - This file contains the code for the broken station problem.
